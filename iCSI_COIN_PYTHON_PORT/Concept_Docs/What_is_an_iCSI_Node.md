# What is an iCSI Coin Node?

**The iCSI Coin Node is a fully functional, real-world blockchain application.**

Unlike many educational tools that simulate blockchain behavior, this software **IS** real blockchain technology. It operates on the same fundamental principles as Bitcoin, utilizing:

*   **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Discovery:** Nodes autonomously find and connect to one another across the network to propagate blocks and transactions.
*   **Proof of Work (PoW):** The network is secured by cryptographic mining, adhering to the same consensus mechanisms that power major cryptocurrencies.
*   **Decentralized Ledger:** Every node maintains its own copy of the blockchain, ensuring no single entity controls the data.

## Key Capabilities

The **End User Node** provides a comprehensive suite of tools for interacting with the iCSI Coin network:

*   **Wallet Management:**
    *   Create and manage multiple public/private key pairs.
    *   Import/Export wallets for backup or transfer.
    *   Send and receive real transactions across the network.

*   **Mining Operations:**
    *   **Web Interface Mining:** Mine coins directly from your browser for ease of use.
    *   **RPC Client:** Connect external, high-performance miners via the remote procedure call (RPC) interface.
    *   **Real-Time Stats:** Monitor hashrate, difficulty, and block rewards in real-time.

*   **Blockchain Exploration:**
    *   Inspect individual blocks and verify transactions.
    *   Trace the history of the chain from the Genesis block to the current tip.
    *   Visualize the immutable ledger as it grows.

*   **Network Intelligence:**
    *   View active peers and connection status.
    *   Monitor network difficulty adjustments and halving events.

In essence, running an iCSI Coin Node is running a piece of the live network infrastructure, giving you hands-on experience with the engine that drives the crypto economy.
